# Project Zeus

This is a toy 3D renderer written in Rust. It's a personal learning project and shouldn't be used for anything, anywhere (ever!?)

# Why the name

It's named Project Zeus because I love Peep Show and every time I see the name it makes me laugh.

# Dependencies

It requires SDL. I'm coding this on Ubuntu - so for future me, you just need to run this:

<code>sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev</code>
